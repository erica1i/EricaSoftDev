          <h4>Nibbles</h4>
          <p>This is Nibbles. He is of the species hamstar and found his orgins in a Dave &#38; Buster's arcade.
		  But the arcade was no kindred place and at night, the so called "prizes" had to battle in a fight to the death - 
		  gladitorial style.
		  This was all to appease and entertain the high ranking "game consoles" whose worth was denoted by their hundreds of thousands 
		  of "tickets." Nibbles, desiring his freedom, would battle in this colosseum until he earned a total of 3000 
		  tickets which he used to buy a sombrero - a clever disguise to sneak out of the arcade. After leaving his 
		  gladiator days behind him, Nibbles met DVL and now can be usually usually found residing on his bed, 
		  sometimes even donning the signature sombrero.</p>

          <h4>Hugo</h4>
          <p>This is Hugo. He is ... a bear & hamster? To be honest, I don't really know what he is. I found him when my 
            friend introduced me to him on my birthday in freshman year. He is really sweet and has stuck by me through 
            both good and bad times. 

            Hugo is sometimes temperamental. One time, he met the Angel of Persia and jumped on her to try to get a feather
            from her beautiful wings. That was a HUGE no-no. The Angel of Persia caught him and threatened to skin him alive.
            He never touched an angel's wings without asking first now.
