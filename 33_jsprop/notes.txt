events:
- triggered by user action
- triggered directly in code
- dom elements can be set up to listen for events and respond to them
- nested elements
    - if a parent element receives the same event as child elements, the
    processing order follows bubble and capture

bubble and capture phases in js:

bubble:
- event bubbling: describes how nested elements' events are handled
- parent element: encompassing element
- event goes from most specific to least specific element
- all events are run
--> stopPropagation() prevents the event from moving on to the next element (less specific)

capture:
- event goes from least specific to most specific element
- capture is false on default, so you have to specify capture as true
