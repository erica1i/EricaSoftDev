# Flask()
Takes on the argument for another specific purpose.
In connecting the browser and server interaction, the module-name argument
allows for Flask to locate the module with the name in the argument, get those
files, and create instance folders of them.


# "__name__"
Special Python variable that is set to the name of the current module that
is being run. When you run a Python module with python <module-name>.py, the
interpreter sets the special __name__ variable to have a value __main__. If
this file is being imported from another module, then __name__ will be set to
the moduleâ€™s name. This variable is set by the interpreter, and you can
reference it from your code.
