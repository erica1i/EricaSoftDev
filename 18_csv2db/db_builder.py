DISCO:
- If the csv file doesn't match with the type assigned in the database, it returns a TYPE error
- If the primary key id isn't unique, you get an integrity error
- The primary key id isn't expected unless you write/specify it in the command when you create the database
- If you use the open thing without "with", you must close it yourself
- students_dict is an object of Dictionary --> not a dictionary itself bc we don't get rid of the new lines (??)
