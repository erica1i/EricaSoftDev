 ## Dev Console
 - CRT-SHIFT-I to inspect code... go to static folder and edit CSS directly in the browswer without going to your text editor 
 - This allows you to make changes on the browser itself which then you can later save/copy 
 - make sure to name your css file right or else HTML won't be able to access it
