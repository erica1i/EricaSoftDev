time spent: 1 hr
DISCO:
Split string with split() and its uses for it

QCC:
How to split dictionaries
How to import files and read it
How to find index of certain characters in strings

OPS SUMMARY:
If krewes is empty, return ERROR
Gets a list of the keys in the krewes
Randomly iterates through all the list of keys to determine whether it contains values or not.
If the key is empty, it will remove the key and continue on. If all the keysâ€™ lists are empty, return ERROR.
When one of the keys is found to have a non-empty list, this key is chosen.
Choose a random index from list associated with chosen key
Return value at the random index of the associated key.

New Part:
Function to change string into a dictionary. 

To choose ducky, we will create another dictionary with identical index values of the person it is connected with.
Now, we will return the period and index of the person.
With those values we will select the corresponding ducky
