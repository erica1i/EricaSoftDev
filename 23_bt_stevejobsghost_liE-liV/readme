K23 - Testing out Bootstrap Features
Soft Dev
2022-11-29
time spent: 2.0 hr

DISCO:
# is used as placeholders in bootstrap
NAV BAR stands for navigation bar, an area on a page that contains links, buttons, etc (navigational stuff)
NavBars can extend or collaspe, depending on the device dimensions & size
Certain features such as dropdowns require extra JS (Poppers)
Navbars can be fixed to the top but the <body> will need padding
Bootstrap offers buttons and alerts with a range of colors and porposes

QCC:
Saw that there were style options forms, but didnt really get to explore
