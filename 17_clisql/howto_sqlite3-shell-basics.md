## Overview
SQ

### Estimated Time Cost: 0.5 hrs

### Prerequisites:
(Making permanent aliases in bash)
1. Have sqlit3 installed


Some stuf:
* the .excel command returns nothing until you enter your next command, which is then returned in a csv file.
* .mode is a helpful tool when looking at databases, can make things easier to read when returned
* Nothing is forever :( and that applies to your created databases in the terminal too (unless you save them). 
### Resources
* entering in ```.help``` in your sqlit3 shell gives you a hint about all the 
commands at your disposal
