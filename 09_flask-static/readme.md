## WEBSERVERS VS. WEBBROWERS 
- Web Browswers is software that allow the users to broswe the web
    (ie Firefox, Safari, Google)
- Web Servers returns a response. 

In app.py, the code created a web server that serves/opens a page that
says "No hablo queso!" It is a static server at the moment which is why refreshing
the page does not change anything about the actual server itself.
